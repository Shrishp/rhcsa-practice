How to Reset Root Password in RHEL 9 (VM/Server)
Recently, I explored how to reset the root password on a RHEL 9 system â€” a crucial recovery task for any Linux user or system administrator.

This hands-on experience helped me understand the GRUB boot process, emergency mode, and SELinux relabeling. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how Linux offers robust mechanisms for system recovery, and Iâ€™m excited to keep learning more!

Restart or Start the VM: Reboot or power on your virtual machine.
Enter GRUB Menu: Press the â†‘â†“ arrow keys rapidly during boot to access the GRUB menu.
Select Rescue Kernel: Highlight the rescue kernel using the arrow keys, then press e to edit.

4. Modify Linux Line: Locate the line that starts with â€˜linuxâ€™. Replace ro (read-only) with rw (read-write) and append rd.break console=tty0 to pause the boot process for recovery.

5. Boot into Rescue Mode: Press Ctrl+X to boot with the edited settings.

6. Access System Root: Run chroot /sysroot to switch to the systemâ€™s root environment.

8. Enable SELinux Relabeling: Run touch /.autorelabel to update SELinux contexts on reboot.

9. Exit and Reboot: Type exit twice to leave chroot and restart the system.

This process has sharpened my Linux troubleshooting skills, and Iâ€™m excited to share it! Try it out, share your tips in the comments, or pass it along to your network. ðŸš€
